# Risko Platform - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

**Risko** is an AI-powered regional disaster and crisis risk modeling platform specifically designed for Turkey. It addresses the critical need for reliable, holistic risk data in the real estate and insurance sectors.

## Problem Statement

- **Challenge**: Real estate buyers, renters, and insurance companies lack access to comprehensive, reliable risk data
- **Impact**: Insurance companies struggle with accurate risk pricing, citizens don't know which areas are safer
- **Solution**: Risko aggregates multiple data sources to provide unified risk profiles for any Turkish address

## Implemented Features

### 1. Core Risk Analysis Engine âœ…

#### Risk Calculation
- **Earthquake Risk**: Based on seismic zones, fault line proximity, soil composition
- **Flood Risk**: Considers elevation, water body proximity, drainage systems
- **Fire Risk**: Analyzes building age, materials, urban density
- **Landslide Risk**: Evaluates slope gradient, soil stability, vegetation

#### Scoring System
- Individual risk scores: 0-100 scale
- Overall risk calculation: Weighted average
  - Earthquake: 40% (highest severity)
